This warming is leading to more frequent and severe weather events, including heatwaves, storms, and droughts. The impacts of climate change are not only environmental but also affect human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. Mitigating climate change requires collective efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to sustainable practices.\"\n",
        "- Summarize the paragraph discussing the impact of artificial intelligence on employment: \"As artificial intelligence continues to advance, concerns about its impact on employment are growing. While AI has the potential to enhance productivity and create new job opportunities, it also poses the risk of job displacement as automation replaces certain tasks. To address this challenge, there is a need for upskilling the workforce, investing in education, and designing policies that ensure a smooth transition in the labor market.\"\n",
        "- Summarize the complex paragraph on the history of quantum mechanics: \"Quantum mechanics, developed in the early 20th century, revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world. Pioneered by physicists like Max Planck and Albert Einstein, it introduced the concept of quantized energy levels and wave-particle duality. The Schrödinger equation became a cornerstone, describing the evolution of quantum states. Quantum mechanics has led to technological advancements, such as the development of transistors and lasers, and remains a fundamental theory in modern physics.\"\n"
